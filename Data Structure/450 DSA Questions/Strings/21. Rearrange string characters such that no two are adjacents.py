from heapq import *


# Ex__ aab --> O/P --> aba
# Ex__ aaab --> O/P --> abaa ,so not possible to rearrange
#
# IDEA TO SOLVE:
# We will maintain a max heap to get letter with the highest freq.
# 1. Initially we will put all the elements to map with their freq
# 2. Then we will put all the elements from the map to maxHeap
# 3. Then we will run a while loop till maxHeap  does not become empty
# 4. Pop a element from maxHeap which will give letter with highest freq
# 5. put it into result array and decrease the freq count
#    5.1. if prevFreq is not zero means will still have a letter which is not exhausted so we will
#         put back to  maxHeap
# 6. now , update prevFreq = frequency and prevLetter = letter
# 7. At the end if len of result array string is equal to len of S will were able to make or rearrange,
#    string so return it else return empty string
#
