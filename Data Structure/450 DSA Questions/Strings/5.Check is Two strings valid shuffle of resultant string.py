# example:
# 1XY2 is a valid shuffle of XY and 12
# Y12X is not a valid shuffle of XY and 12
# In the above example, we have a string array named results.
# It contains two strings: 1XY2 and Y12X.
# We are checking if these two strings are valid shuffle of strings first(XY) and second(12).
# Here, the program  1XY2 is a valid shuffle of XY and 12.
# However, Y12X is not a valid shuffle.
# This is because Y12X has altered the order of string XY.
# Here, Y is used before X.
# Hence, to be a valid shuffle, the order of string should be maintained.
