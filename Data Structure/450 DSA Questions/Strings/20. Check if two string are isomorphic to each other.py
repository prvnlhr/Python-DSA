# Two strings str1 and str2 are called isomorphic if there is
# a one-to-one mapping possible for every character of str1 to
# every character of str2. And all occurrences of every character
# in ‘str1’ map to the same character in ‘str2’.
#
# Examples:
#
# Input:  str1 = "aab", str2 = "xxy"
# Output: True
# 'a' is mapped to 'x' and 'b' is mapped to 'y'.
#
# Input:  str1 = "aab", str2 = "xyz"
# Output: False
# One occurrence of 'a' in str1 has 'x' in str2 and
# other occurrence of 'a' has 'y'.
