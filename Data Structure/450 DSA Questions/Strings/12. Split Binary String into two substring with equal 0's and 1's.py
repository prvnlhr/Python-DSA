# Given a binary string str of length N, the task is to find the
# maximum count of consecutive substrings str can be divided into
# such that all the substrings are balanced i.e. they have equal
# number of 0s and 1s. If it is not possible to split str satisfying
# the conditions then print -1.

# Input: str = “0100110101”
# Output: 4
# The required substrings are “01”, “0011”, “01” and “01”.
# Input: str = “0111100010”
# Output: 3
#
# Input: str = “0000000000”

# Output: -1
