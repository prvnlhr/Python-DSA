# Input: azxxzy
# Output: ay
# First “azxxzy” is reduced to “azzy”.
# The string “azzy” contains duplicates,so it is further reduced to “ay”.
# Input: geeksforgeeg
# Output: gksfor
# First “geeksforgeeg” is reduced to “gksforgg”. The string “gksforgg”
# contains duplicates, so it is further reduced to “gksfor”.
# Input: caaabbbaacdddd
# Output: Empty String
# Input: acaaabbbacdddd
# Output: acac

# Naive Solution will be to use nested Loops: very Bad Solution

# Better solution:Using STACK
