import BST

# Given a Binary search Tree that contains positive integer values greater than 0.
# The task is to check whether the BST contains a dead end or not.
# Here Dead End means, we are not able to insert any element after that node.
# Input :        8
#              /   \
#            5      9
#          /   \
#         2     7
#        /
#       1

# Output : Yes
# Explanation : Node "1" is the dead End because after that we cant insert any element.
#
# Input :       8
#             /   \
#            7     10
#          /      /   \
#         2      9     13
#
# Output : Yes
# Explanation : We can't insert any element at node 9.
#
# IMPLEMENTATION:___________________________________
# If we take a closer look at the problem, we can notice that we basically need to check if there
# is a leaf node with value x such that x + 1 and x - 1 exist in BST with the exception of x = 1. For x = 1,
# we canâ€™t insert 0 as the problem statement says BST contains positive integers only.
# To implement the above idea we first traverse the whole BST and store all nodes in a hash_map.
# We also store all leaves in a separate hash to avoid re-traversal of BST.
# Finally, we check for every leaf node x, if x-1 and x+1 are present in hash_map or not.
