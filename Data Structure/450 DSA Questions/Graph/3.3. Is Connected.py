# Check if given undirected graph is connected or not

# If each vertex of a graph is connected to one or multiple
# vertices then the graph is called a Connected graph whereas,
# if there exists even one vertex which is not connected to any
# vertex of the graph then it is called Disconnect or not connected graph.

# APPROACH________
# Create a boolean visited [] array. Start DFS from any vertex and mark
# the visited vertices in the visited[] array. Once DFS is completed
# check the iterate the visited [] and count all the trueâ€™s.
# If this count is equal to no of vertices means all vertices are traveled
# during DFS implies graph is connected if the count is not equal to no of
# vertices implies all the vertices are not traveled means graph is not connected or disconnected.
