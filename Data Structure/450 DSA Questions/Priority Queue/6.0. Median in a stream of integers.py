# Making it clear, when the input size is odd, we take the
# middle element of sorted data. If the input size is even,
# we pick the average of the middle two elements in the sorted stream.


# Method 1: Insertion Sort
# # If we can sort the data as it appears, we can easily locate the
# # median element. Insertion Sort is one such online algorithm that
# # sorts the data appeared so far. At any instance of sorting, say
# # after sorting i-th element, the first i elements of the array are sorted.
# # The insertion sort doesn’t depend on future data to sort data input till
# # that point. In other words, insertion sort considers data sorted so far
# # while inserting the next element. This is the key part of insertion sort
# # that makes it an online algorithm.
# # However, insertion sort takes O(n2) time to sort n elements.


# EFFICIENT SOL USING HEAP:
# Time Complexity: If we omit the way how stream was read, complexity of
# median finding is O(N log N), as we need to read the stream,
# and due to heap insertions/deletions.
#
# Auxiliary Space: O(N)

# As we read a num from input we put it to heap and find median till that point
