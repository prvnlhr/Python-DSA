# Input : arr[] = {7, 3, 2, 4, 9, 12, 56} , m = 3
# Output: Minimum Difference is 2
# Explanation:
# We have seven packets of chocolates and
# we need to pick three packets for 3 students
# If we pick 2, 3 and 4, we get the minimum
# difference between maximum and minimum packet sizes.
#
# Input : arr[] = {3, 4, 1, 9, 56, 7, 9, 12} , m = 5
# Output: Minimum Difference is 6
# Explanation:
# The set goes like 3,4,7,9,9 and the output
# is 9-3 = 6
#
# Input : arr[] = {12, 4, 7, 9, 2, 23, 25, 41,

# 43, 50} , m = 7
# Output: Minimum Difference is 10
# Explanation:
# We need to pick 7 packets. We pick 40, 41,
# 42, 44, 48, 43 and 50 to minimize difference
# between maximum and minimum.
