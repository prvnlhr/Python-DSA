# Time complexity : O(NlogN)
# Space complexity : O(NlogN) or O(N)

# STEPS:
# 1. Sort the array on basis of first element(start) of pair [[start,end],[start,end]]
# 2. Initialize stack with first element of array
# 3. for every element of input arr, there may be two conditions,
# ____if not overlapping --> since the array is sorted on basis of their start value, so to check
#                            overlapping we can compare curr element start top stack_top start,
#                            if stack_top start is smaller then no overlapping,hence append curr top stack
# ____if overlapping --> we do not check anything just change the stack top elements end with max(stack_top_end ,curr_end)


def mergeInterval(arr):
    # Sorting based on the increasing order
    # of the start intervals

    arr.sort(key=lambda x: x[0])
    stack = []
    # initialize stack with arr first element,
    stack.append(arr[0])

    for curr in arr:
        # for every element in arr,
        stack_top = stack[-1]
        stack_top_end = stack_top[1]
        curr_start = curr[0]

        # if this condition satisfies then there is no overlapping
        if stack_top_end < curr_start:
            stack.append(curr)
        # else there is overlapping just change the stack top element and move for next iteration
        else:
            stack_top[1] = max(stack_top[1], curr[1])
    return stack
