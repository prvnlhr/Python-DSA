# The idea is: We will traverse the first array and compare it with the first element of the second array.
# If the first element of the second array is smaller than the first array then we will swap and then sort the second array.
# First, we have to traverse array1 and then compare it with the first element of array2.
# If it is less than array1 then swap we swap both.
#
# After swapping we are going to sort the array2 again so that the smallest element of the array2
# comes at the first position and we can again swap with the array1
# To sort the array2 we will store the first element of array2 in a variable and left shift all the element and store
# the first element in array2 in the last.
