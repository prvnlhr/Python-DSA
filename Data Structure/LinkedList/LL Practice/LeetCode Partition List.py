# # Leetcode Sol:
# The problem wants us to reform the linked list structure, such that the elements lesser that a certain value x,
# come before the elements greater or equal to x. This essentially means in this reformed list,
# there would be a point in the linked list before which all the elements would be smaller than x and after
# which all the elements would be greater or equal to x. Let's call this point as the JOINT.
#
#
# Reverse engineering the question tells us that if we break the reformed list at the JOINT, we will get
# two smaller linked lists, one with lesser elements and the other with elements greater or equal to x.
# In the solution, our main aim is to create these two linked lists and join them.
#
#
# Approach 1: Two Pointer Approach
# Intuition
#
# We can take two pointers before and after to keep track of the two linked lists as described above.
# These two pointers could be used two create two separate lists and then these lists could be combined
# to form the desired reformed list.
#
# Algorithm
#
# 1. Initialize two pointers before and after. In the implementation we have initialized these two with a dummy ListNode.
# This helps to reduce the number of conditional checks we would need otherwise. You can try an implementation where you
# don't initialize with a dummy node and see it yourself!
#
# 2. Iterate the original linked list, using the head pointer.
#
# 3. If the node's value pointed by head is lesser than x, the node should be part of the before list.
# So we move it to before list.
#
# 4. Else, the node should be part of after list. So we move it to after list.
#
#
# 5. Once we are done with all the nodes in the original linked list, we would have two list before and after.
# The original list nodes are either part of before list or after list, depending on its value.
#
#
# Note: Since we traverse the original linked list from left to right, at no point would the order of nodes
# change relatively in the two lists. Another important thing to note here is that we show the original linked
# list intact in the above diagrams. However, in the implementation, we remove the nodes from the original linked
# list and attach them in the before or after list. We don't utilize any additional space. We simply move the nodes
# from the original list around.
#
# 6. Now, these two lists before and after can be combined to form the reformed list.
#
#
# We did a dummy node initialization at the start to make implementation easier, you don't want that to be
# part of the returned list, hence just move ahead one node in both the lists while combining the two list.
# Since both before and after have an extra node at the front.
#
# CODE:
def partition(head, x):
    before = before_head = ListNode(0)
    after = after_head = ListNode(0)

    while head:
        if head.val < x:
            before.next = head
            before = before.next
        else:
            after.next = head
            after = after.next

        head = head.next
    after.next = None
    before.next = after_head.next
    return before_head.next
